### :muscle: Motivation for the project:
My motivation for this project was to gain more experience in analysing and manipulating dataset, during a project we get a lot of knowledge, because we face our problems and difficulties, forcing us to many times search on google to find the correct piece of code. I can say that after had finished this project I'm more close to become a data scientist than before, and that's why I decided to do this project.
