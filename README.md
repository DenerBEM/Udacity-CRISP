# Udacity-CRISP
**Description:** *Analyze a dataset and answer 5 business questions*

### :package: Libraries used:
`import pandas as pd`<br>
`import numpy as np`<br>
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`<br>
`import seaborn as sns`<br>




### :muscle: Motivation for the project:
My motivation for this project was to gain more experience in analysing and manipulating dataset, during a project we get a lot of knowledge, because we face our problems and difficulties, forcing us to many times search on google to find the correct piece of code. I can say that after had finished this project I'm more close to become a data scientist than before, and that's why I decided to do this project.

*You should download the year 2017* 

### :bar_chart: Results:

I had to answer this 5 questions:

* Better countries have better salaries ?
* Which gender has the highest salary ?
* Do those who work from home are those who Program as hobby as well ?
* Do the larger company have more employees who work from home ?
* What race has the highest salary ?

Although I need more knowledge, experience and probably hypothesis tests to answer these questions, I really dive deep into the exploratory data analysis, and I used most of times descriptive statistics to answer these questions.
The answers you can find in the commentaries in jupyter notebook.

### :boy: Author:
My name is Dener, I'm 25 years old, and I've studied Data Science since 2019, and I've been putting my knowledge in practice by doing some personal projects and publish them on GitHub.
I hope you enjoy reading my codes.
